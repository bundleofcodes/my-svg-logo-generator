# My-SVG-Logo-Generator

## Description:

The purpose of this project was to create an application that enables users to enter their inputs into an inquirer prompt in order to generate a logo.svg file, which contains the users desired results and rendering an SVG image. I learned how to run the debug with help of Jest to test the code for the shapes to ensure all parameters passed testing to allow for the apllication to function properly.
